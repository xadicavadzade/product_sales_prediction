# House Price Prediction - Resource-Limited Implementation


A machine learning project for predicting house prices using Random Forest, demonstrating practical ML development under computational constraints.


# Project Overview
This project implements house price prediction using Random Forest algorithm, with a focus on working within limited computational resources. The model achieves reasonable performance while maintaining efficiency and practicality.


Current Performance: R² Score = 0.0633 | MSE = 420.17



# ⚠️ Performance Note:

The current results reflect resource limitations rather than model capability. With increased computational resources, significantly better performance is achievable through ensemble methods and hyperparameter optimization.
